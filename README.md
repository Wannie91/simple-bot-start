## Version
0.1.0

## Description
A simple mod for Factorio where you start the game with exoskeleton armor with 1x fission reactor, 2x personal robotports MK2, night vision, 1x exoskeleton and 50x fusion constructrion robots. The exoskeleton armor offers no protection and its grid is locked so equipment can't be taken out. Fusion construction robots are fireproof, don't need to recharge and are initially faster than their vanilla counterpart. Their max speed is limited, however, which means that normal construction robots become faster after researching worker robot speed 5. 

In single player, the mod attempts to spawn the exoskeleton armor and fusion construction robots in the debris of the spaceship. Due to the vanilla function "insert_safe" of the "freeplay" scenario, it can happen that no all items are inserted. In this case there is a custom command, /sbs-give-armor, that allows players to spawn the items in their inventory. In multiplayer, the two items are spawn directly in the inventory of the players at the start of the game. 

The sprites of the fusion construction robots were inspired by the mod "fusion robots" of mindmix. As the mod is rather old and its graphis not up-to-date, I tried to make the bots look "fusion" myself.
