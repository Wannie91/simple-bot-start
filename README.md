## Version
0.1.0

## Description
A simple mod for Factorio where you start the game with basic exoskeleton armor with 1x fission reactor, 2x personal robotports MK2, night vision, 1x exoskeleton and 50x fusion construction robots. The exoskeleton armor offers no protection and its grid is locked so items can't be taken out. The fusion reactor robots require no recharge and are fireproof but have their max speed limited. Normal construction robots should be faster after researching Worker robot speed 5. 

In singleplayer, the mod attempts to spawn the exoskeleton armor and fusion construction robots in the debris of the spaceship. Due to the vanilla function "insert_safe" of the "freeplay" scenario, it can happen that not all items are inserted. In this case there is a custom command, /sbs-give-armor, that allows players to spawn the armor and fusion construction robots. In multiplayer, the items should show up at directly in the inventory of the players at the start of the game.
